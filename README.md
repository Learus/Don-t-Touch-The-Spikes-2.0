# Don-t-touch-the-spikes-2.0

This is a clone of the popular game with the same title.
It is a practice project, used for familirization with some of Unity's "new" features as well as techniques I've not used before.

We will test out:

* New Unity UI
* Scene Transitions
* Animator Animations for 2D
* General 2D Polishing
* Github and VSCode Integrations
* 2D Lighting with URP - 2D Renderer Experimental Features
* Smooth sound effects
